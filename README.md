# apuri_v2

> Another helper project using Flutter

Made 2021 by Arttu YlhÃ¤vuori. See the [license](#License) below.

## Current features

- Write / paste some text to the text field & press the play button
  - -> The helper adds three slashes ('///' = [XML documentation comments in C# language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/)) before each row
- 'camelCase' -> 'camel case' (add spaces to camelCase styled text & change text to lower case)
- The first two features are presented in their own tabs

## Plans for upcoming features

- Select what you want to add to each row (before & after each row)
- Add a checkbox: indent every row (\t)
- Add a checkbox: add '///' or '//' to every row (= partly refactor an existing feature)
- 'camel case' -> 'camelCase' (normal text to camelCase styled text; the opposite for an existing feature)
- Add localizations (using i10n: English, Finnish, Swedish)
- Add dark theme that is used based on the system setting (= dark theme at night)
