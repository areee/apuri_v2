(c) 2021 by Arttu YlhÃ¤vuori

## Current features
- Write / paste some text to the text field & press the play button
  - -> The helper adds three slashes ('///' = [XML documentation comments in C# language](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/xmldoc/)) before each row

## Plans for upcoming features
- Select what you want to add to each row (before & after each row)
- 'camelCase' -> 'camel case' (add spaces to camelCase styled text & change text to lower case)
