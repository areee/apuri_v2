# apuri_v2

>  Another helper project using Flutter 

## Current features
- Write / paste some text to the text field & press the play button
  - -> The helper adds three slashes ('///' = XML commented text in .NET Core) before each row

## Plans for upcoming features
- Select what you want to add to each row (before & after each row)
- 'camelCase' -> 'camel case' (add spaces to camelCase styled text & change text to lower case)
